The federal government was woefully unprepared, both in manpower and ideas, for ensuring that the rights of ex-slaves were respected after the war. Sure, slavery might be effectively dead as of April 14, 1865, when Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, but was the U.S. military there to enforce freedom on the plantations? Largely, no. The immediate months after the war were filled with violence as whites killed newly freed people in the countryside, especially as they began to flee for cities like Memphis and New Orleans. For cotton planters, this black flight was a real threat. They prospered on owning black labor. If they couldn’t own that labor, planters at least needed to keep it on the land to pick the cotton that might allow them to rebuild their economic base. <a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/11/day-labor-history-november-25-1865\">Read whole article</a>","image":"http://web.mit.edu/21h.102/www/Primary%20source%20collections/Reconstruction/Black%20codes.htm","place":"","location":"#N/A","video":"","source":"","source_url":"","additional_resources":"http://web.mit.edu/21h.102/www/Primary%20source%20collections/Reconstruction/Black%20codes.htm","year":1865},{"title":"National Labor Union demands Congress implement the 8-hour day","start":"1866-08-20T00:00:00.000Z","end":"","description":"On August 20, 1866, the National Labor Union, the first labor union federation in U.S. history, demanded Congress implement a national 8-hour day.

Originally, western employers hired the Chinese to do menial work, but the angry response from west coast labor that led to the Chinese Exclusion Act, the first major legislative victory for organized labor in the nation’s history, ended that supply in 1882. So employers turned to Japan. Japan in the 1880s was modernizing rapidly, but was still poor. Encouraging migration was a useful way to undermine internal social problems. Almost immediately after 1882, Japanese migration to the United States soared. Much of this was to the sugar plantations of the American soon-to-be colony in Hawaii, but large numbers came to California, Oregon, and Washington as well.

The entrance of the nation into World War I that spring seemed to place the entire nation on edge. Progressivism, a diverse movement with widely mixed motivations among its members, showed its dark side like never before, using the increasingly activist federal government to suppress all perceived threats to middle-class, patriotic America. The Wilson Administration cracked down on dissent, passing the Espionage Act in June, a law used, along with several other laws passed during the war, to crack down on any criticism of the war. Anti-immigrant movements increased their activities–after nearly 40 years of intense immigration, Americans’ feared more than ever immigrants’ impact upon the nation. The prohibition movement also took advantage of the war, using the connection between immigrants and alcohol to push through the 18th Amendment. Vigilante attacks against labor organizers, particularly radical labor, increased. To name one notorious incident, I.W.W. organizer Frank Little was lynched in the summer of 1917 in Butte, Montana and probably by Pinkertons (a future topic in this series).<a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/07/this-date-in-labor-history-july-12-1917\">Read whole article</a>","image":"http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Bisbee_deportation_guns.jpg","place":"Bisbee, Arizona","location":"31.4481481,-109.9284025","video":"","source":"","source_url":"","additional_resources":"","year":1917},{"title":"Eugene Debs arrested for violating Espionage Act.","start":"1918-06-15T23:00:00.000Z","end":"","description":"On June 16, 1918, the socialist leader and former head of the American Railway Union Eugene Debs gave a speech in Canton, Ohio, criticizing the United States’ actions in World War I and urging resistance to the draft.

The I.W.W. had stationed at least two shooters on a hill approximately ¼ mile away. In addition, some of the workers in the hall had weapons. In the hail of bullets, four American Legion members died.

Officially known as the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, Landrum-Griffin used union corruption as an excuse for a broad-based attack upon organized labor on issues completely unrelated to corruption. The passage of this bill was another major blow to organized labor in the early years of the Cold War that moved power away from unions and back to corporations. <a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2014/09/day-labor-history-september-14-1959\">Read whole article</a>","image":"","place":"","location":"#N/A","video":"","source":"","source_url":"","additional_resources":"","year":1959},{"title":"Lettuce workers go on strike in Imperial Valley, starts era of farmworker organizing","start":"1961-01-16T00:00:00.000Z","end":"","description":"On January 16, 1961, lettuce workers in the Imperial Valley of California walked off the job in one of the first modern actions of agricultural worker militancy that would eventually lead to the rise of the United Farm Workers and other farmworker unions in the 1960s and 1970s.<a href=\"http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2016/01/this-day-in-labor-history-january-16-1961\">Read whole article</a>","image":"http://lawyersgunsmon.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/strike_enlarge-300x225.jpg","place":"","location":"#N/A","video":"","source":"","source_url":"","additional_resources":"","year":1961},{"title":"President Kennedy issues Executive Order 10988, authorizing collective bargaining for public workers","start":"1962-01-17T00:00:00.000Z","end":"","description":"Public sector workers were not granted collective bargaining rights under the National Labor Relations Act; as great as that law was for American labor, there were actually a number of important categories of workers left out, including agricultural labor and government workers.

Previous to graduate school, Paul worked for several years on global justice issues at Public Citizen’s Global Trade Watch.</em>On January 25, 1984, William Thompson, a leader with the International Nestle Boycott Committee (INBC) met with Nestlé executive Carl Angst in New York City. There, the two men announced a surprise: after seven years of a global boycott of Nestlé, U.S. organizers were suspending this effort in light of new Nestlé initiatives intended to address activists’ critiques. Ending ten months later, the Nestlé boycott set important precedents for liberal and left-wing activists in challenging multinational corporate power.
